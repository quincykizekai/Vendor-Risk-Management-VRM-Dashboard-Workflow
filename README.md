# Initech Security Solutions – Vendor Risk Management

This project delivers a full end-to-end Vendor Risk Management solution, built around an Excel based assessment template to keep your third-party risks fresh and visible.

**What I Did:**  
- **Defined a four-category risk framework** (Financial Health, Data Sensitivity, Geographic Risk, Compliance) with clear 1–5 scoring criteria and category weights.  
- **Built an Excel assessment template** that captures raw vendor scores, normalizes them, and calculates a composite risk score and tier (Low/Medium/High).  
- **Authored a Scoring Guide** detailing how each criterion is measured and weighted, ensuring consistency across assessments.  

By combining structured data collection with automation and analytics, this solution streamlines vendor oversight, reduces manual effort, and provides executives with real-time risk insights.
